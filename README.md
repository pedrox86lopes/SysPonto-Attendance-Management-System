# Setup Instructions
## Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

## Prerequisites
Python 3.8+

<p>Django 4.0+

<p>PostgreSQL (or your preferred database)

## Redis Server:
Linux (Debian/Ubuntu): sudo apt update && sudo apt install redis-server

<p>macOS (Homebrew): brew install redis

## Windows: Refer to the official Redis documentation for installation.

## Ensure your Redis server is running before starting the Django application.

1. Clone the Repository
git clone <repository_url> # Replace with your actual repository URL
cd attendance_system

2. Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
python -m venv venv

3. Activate the Virtual Environment
macOS/Linux:

source venv/bin/activate

Windows:

.\venv\Scripts\activate

## 4. Install Dependencies
Install all required Python packages using pip:

pip install -r requirements.txt # Assuming you have a requirements.txt, or:

<p>pip install Django daphne channels channels_redis redis

## 5. Database Setup
Apply database migrations and create a superuser:

python manage.py makemigrations

<p>python manage.py migrate

<p>python manage.py createsuperuser # Follow prompts to create an admin user

## 6. Run the Development Server
Start the Django Channels development server using Daphne:


<p>daphne -b 0.0.0.0 -p 8000 attendance_system.asgi:application


<p>Your application should now be accessible at http://127.0.0.1:8000/.

# Populate with Test Data
cd attendance_system_django
<p> python manage.py create_test_data --clear
  
## Quick Reset for Fresh Testing:
python3 manage.py clean_database --confirm

Run again: <p> python manage.py create_test_data --clear

# Usage
## Access the Admin Panel: Log in as the superuser at http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ to:
Create Users (assign roles: student, teacher, admin).

<p>Create Courses.

<p>Create Class Sessions for courses.

<p>Enroll students in courses (Enrollment model).

# Student Dashboard:

<p>Click "Validate" next to a student's name to confirm their attendance.

## Future Enhancements
Interactive Calendar: Fully integrate Calendar handling 30 days next of classes.


<p>Attendance Plots: Implement interactive statistical plots (e.g., bar charts of attendance frequency, line graphs over time) using libraries like Chart.js or Plotly.js.


<p>User Profile Management: Allow users to update their own profiles.


<p>Notifications UI: Enhance notification display with more visually appealing elements or a dedicated notification center.


<p>Search and Filtering: Add search and filter options for courses, classes, and attendance records in dashboards.
